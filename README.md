***Museum of Candy Project Bootstrap***

*I did this project to help me practice coding using Bootstrap classes.*

*It includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a little bit of JavaScript.*

*This document is responsive on all screen devices. Also, it implements the Bootstrap grid system and a lot of utilities from the docs like flex, spacing and etc...*
